MAE598/494: Design Optimization covers mathematical modeling, optimization theory, and computational methods for analytical and simulation-based optimal engineering design. Key areas include:

- Unconstrained Optimization: Covers convexity, optimality conditions, gradient descent, convergence, modern line search techniques, Newton's method, and practical exercises.
- Supervised Learning: Involves ordinary least square, design of experiments, and practical applications.
- Constrained Optimization: Focuses on reduced gradient, KKT conditions, geometry sensitivity analysis, quasi-Newton methods, active set strategy, and Sequential Quadratic Programming.
- Optimal Control: Discusses Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle, Markov decision process, Bellman Equation, and practical applications.
